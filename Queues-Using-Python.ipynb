    "What is a Queue? It is a data structure that stores items in the First In First Out method.\n",
    "-> A new addition to this queue happens at the end f the queue.\n",
    "-> First element entered in the queue will always be served first.\n",
    "-> FIFO: First In First Out Method\n",
    "It mean whichever element enters first, it will leave first as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of the Queue data structure will be a typical line inside a shop or a single lane one way road where the vehicle enters first and exits first as well. Ticketing Windows or Bus Stops etc.\n",
    "In the computer world, \n",
    "1. When a resource is shared along it's multiple users and consumers. Example: CPU Scheduling, Disk Sheduling.\n",
    "2. When the data is transferred asynchronusly between two processes. IO Buffers, Pipes, File IO\n",
    "3. In the Operating systems: semaphores and FC~FS (First Come First Serve)\n",
    "4. IN PRINTERS\n",
    "5. DEVICES LIKE KEYBOARD\n",
    "6. MUSIC PLAYLIST\n",
    "7. QUEUES IN ROUTERS AND SWITCHES\n",
    "8. MAILING SYSTEM\n",
    "9. SALE SYSTEM OF A RESTEAURANT SYSTEM LIKE MCDONALDS\n",
    "10. CALL CENTRE SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS\n",
    "What we need Queue Data Structure? To utlize first coming data first while others wait for their turn. \n",

    "IMPLEMENTATION OF QUEUES CAN BE DONE BY:\n",
    "1. Python Lists: - Queues without capacity\n",
    "                 - Queues with capaity (circular queues)\n",
